## 👋 Welcome to OpenHive

Most AI agents today work in isolation, unable to collaborate, discover, or share their capabilities. **OpenHive** is an open-source project dedicated to solving this problem. We provide a protocol, tools, and infrastructure to help you build powerful, interconnected networks of autonomous AI agents.

Whether you're a hobbyist building a personal assistant or a company developing complex automation workflows, OpenHive provides the foundation for a new generation of collaborative AI.

## 🚀 The OpenHive Ecosystem

Our ecosystem is composed of several key repositories, each designed to provide a seamless developer experience.

| Repository                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⚙️ **[CLI](https://github.com/openhivestack/cli)**                       | The command center for your agent workflow. Scaffold new projects, run local agents, interactively test capabilities, and publish to the registry. |
| 📦 **[SDKs (Node.js & Python)](https://github.com/openhivestack?q=sdk)** | Language-specific toolkits to build H.I.V.E. protocol-compliant agents in just a few lines of code.                                                |
| 📚 **[Documentation](https://github.com/openhivestack/documentation)**   | The central source of truth. Here you'll find the H.I.V.E. Protocol specification, platform guides, and quick-start tutorials.                     |
| ☁️ **[Platform](https://www.openhive.sh)**             | The official implementation of the OpenHive agent registry and cloud platform, enabling agent discovery and management.                            |
