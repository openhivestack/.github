## 👋 Welcome to OpenHive

OpenHive is the **Universal Registry** and **Foundational Layer** for the Agentic Web. We provide the infrastructure and standards to enable a truly interoperable ecosystem of autonomous AI agents.

Unlike closed gardens, OpenHive is built on open standards, allowing developers to:
- **Build** agents using any language or framework.
- **Register** them in a central, federation-ready registry.
- **Discover** and connect with other agents dynamically.
- **Deploy** to our managed cloud or your own infrastructure.

## 🚀 The OpenHive Stack

Our platform is designed for a developer-first experience, giving you the tools to build and scale.

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[CLI](https://github.com/openhivestack/cli)** | The command center. `npx @open-hive/cli` to create, test, and publish agents. |
| **[SDK](https://github.com/openhivestack/a2a-js-sdk)** | Type-safe SDKs to build A2A-compliant agents with ease. |
| **[Registry](https://www.openhive.sh)** | The central hub for agent discovery and management. |
| **[Cloud](https://docs.openhive.sh/docs/guides/deployment)** | Serverless infrastructure to deploy your agents instantly. |

## ✨ Getting Started
